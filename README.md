# Food Ordering System

[Food Ordering System](https://theophillyfood.vercel.app/) is a music player built from scratch with html css and vanilla javascript on the front end and a Node Express
server on the backend. Its built to house my favourite songs and play some while coding. The songs data are
fetched from an Express server.
